CIMI
====

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/StratusLab/cimi.png)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/StratusLab/cimi)

This repository contains the Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface
(CIMI) for the StratusLab cloud distribution.

Standard
--------

CIMI is a standard endorsed by the DMTF, [Distributed Management Task
Force](http://dmtf.org/).  It describes a general management model and
a concrete RESTful HTTP-based protocol.  The DMTF publishes both the
[standard][cimi] and a [primer][primer].

Building and Installing
-----------------------

The code and be built via the standard maven commands.  To build
everything and to run the tests, execute the following from the
top-level directory:

    $ mvn clean install

On machines where the `rpmbuild` command is available, the RPM package
will also be generated.

Running the full tests requires having a Couchbase server running on
the build machine with administrator credentials of "admin/ADMIN4".
To execute the build without a Couchbase server, add the option
`-DNO_DB_TESTS` to the above command.

To run the service, you must have [Couchbase][couchbase] already
installed, configured, and running.  The CIMI server will use the
`default` bucket without authentication by default.

**NOTE**: There is a known problem with the Couchbase Java API when
using Java 1.7.  If you see failures when reading the database views,
switch to a version of Java 1.6 instead.  More details can be found in
the [bug report][cb-bug].


Feedback and Bug Reports
------------------------

This code is in an alpha state and quickly evolving.  Nonetheless,
feedback on the code and its functionality is appreciated; please send
this feedback to the [support mailing
list](mailto:support@stratuslab.eu).  Specific bug reports can be
provided via the GitHub issues for this project.
