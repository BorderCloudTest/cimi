Standard
--------

CIMI is a standard endorsed by the DMTF, [Distributed Management Task
Force](http://dmtf.org/).  It describes a general management model and
a concrete RESTful HTTP-based protocol.  The DMTF publishes both the
[standard](http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0263_1.0.0.pdf)
and a
[primer](http://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP2027_1.0.0.pdf).
